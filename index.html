                    In digital marketing, Facebook and Google are known as walled gardens. By aggressively centralizing
                    and guarding vast amounts of audience data behind closed doors, they secure the bulk of the
                    attention economy. The valued commodity behind these walls is us—habituated, surveilled, weary-eyed.

                    <i>Open Garden</i> is a durational participatory performance by artist Alice Yuan Zhang,
                    experimenting with the potentiality of our online attention and the labor of digital sovereignty. A
                    garden plot is livestreamed by solar power to the distributed web. Instructions are freely
                    negotiated by site visitors throughout each week, then carried out by the artist. Over the course of
                    a month, <i>Open Garden</i> acts as substrate for active reflection.
                    <p>
                        Can we begin to decommodify our attention and reclaim digital agency? Where might we direct that
                        attention, and what grows from it? How do we negotiate individual instincts with collective
                        responsibility? What does it mean to govern ourselves in consideration of pace, place, and
                        perspective?

                        <b>ABOUT THE GARDEN</b><br><br>

                        This particular plot of soil shown in the livestream is based on Tongva, Chumash, and Kizh land.
                        Weather here is generally dry and sunny in the Spring, with daytime temperatures ranging from
                        70-80° F and evenings at around 50-60° F. The garden's fate will change based on the living
                        assemblage of instructions generated here each week, as well as the moderation of the artist.
                        The project will run until mid-April or longer.

                        <br>
                        You are currently on a Beaker browser, which runs the Hypercore protocol. Hypercore (hyper://)
                        is a peer-to-peer network where data is held and exchanged between site visitor only. Instead of
                        a central server such as Amazon Web Services, we each can have a direct role in keeping this
                        site live.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Simply click on <img src="images/hyper-host-icon.png"></img> in the top right corner, then
                            toggle "Host this Hyperdrive".</b> This makes you a node of the network of people hosting
                        <i>Open Garden</i>. Now, whenever you are here, new visitors will be also be able to access the
                        garden. The more people we have hosting together, the more likely the site will be accessible at
                        any given time.
